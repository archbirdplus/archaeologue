This is a discord bot that downloads all the messages in a discord server to plot users' activity (in messages per day) over time.

## Commands: 
`/help` - List the bot's commands
`/update` - Update the bot's internal cache of users' messages
`/plot` - Reply with an image plotting the activity on the server over time

The files will be stored under the `data/` directory. See `data/README.md` for the file format.
